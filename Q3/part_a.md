<p>Frechet Distance is the best choice to compare distances between any two different paths</p>
<h4>Advantages</h4>
<uL>
  <li>It takes into account both the position and sequence of points, making it ideal for paths that need to be compared based on their shape and traversal.</li>
  <li>Takes into account the direction in which path is traversed</li>
</uL>
<h4>Some more metrics are:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Euclidean distance</li>
  <li>Hausdorff Distance</li>
  
</ul>
