<h2>Introduction</h2>
Hi, this is Vinayak Bhamblani, i just completed my second year in Mechanical Engineering and I am also pursuing a minor degree in CMinds.
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>I wanted to join the AIC since the time it was formed because of my interest in the field of AI/ML and this was one team that is solely dedicated for that.But the motivation grew stronger when the project of InstiGPT was announced. I wanted to join the team of InstiGPT but could not because i was not well versed with generative AI at that time.At that time i even tried to play with langchain and RAG to try to build something similar of my own but failed miserably.</p>
<p>i feel that this is the perfect oppotunity to join the team and be part of such great projects and of those that are yet to come.</p>
<p>One thing i can assure is that i love working on problems involving AI/ML and learn new things both related to theory or coding along the way. I can literally work for hours to solve the problem without thinking about if i have a quiz tomorrow of what if i miss the classes tomorrow.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I would try my best to contribute something new to every project/problem statement taken up by AIC with my skills and knowledge.</li>
  <li>I think in the race of GenAI and in house foundtational models,India is lagging a bit behind in the race.OpenAI is coming up with bindblowing things every other month(take sora or gpt-4o),google is coming up with new AI models and features frequently.I think as an AIC of such profound institute of India we can contribute in someway towards Make AI in India. Surprisingly i found out that a key member responsible for development of GPT-4o is a resisdent of Pune. So one one of my primary goal/vision after joining AIC would be how can we as team help India catch up in this race.India being a very diverse country we can employ generative AI tools/products in many different areas, for eg in a remote place where there is a shortage of teachers, such LLM can easily act like a teacher atleast for the kids of smaller ages.</li>
  <li>My other goal is to learn more from my peers and seniors during my time in AIC and also as a team win competitions across the world :).</li>
  
</ul>
<h3>Knowledge and Skills</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I am well versed with basics of pyhton and conventional machine learning models and the mathematics behind them.</li>
  <li>Constantly trying to learn new things in the domain of GenAI both in terms of theroy, maths and coding.</li>
  <li>Well versed with basic ML libraries and know the basics of deep learning libraries like keras/tensorflow.</li>  
</ul>
<h4>Achievements</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Top 15 in AI/ML GC.</li>
  <il>⁠Runner up in Sustanify 24, a hackathon conducted by Sustainability Cell.</il>
  <li> ⁠Top 10 in Energenius, Hackathon conducted on Energy Day.</li>
  <li>Top 10 in a boot camp organised by Pathway on utilization of RAG</li>
</ul>
