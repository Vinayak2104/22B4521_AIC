<h2>Dual Chatbot System</h2>
<h3>Motivation behind making this</h3>
<p>There are many times when we come across a research paper and we are not able to understand it or have many doubts in those situations we can just simply make a chatbot and provide it relevant documents and it can answer your questions.</p>
<p>But sometimes we dont even know what questions to ask specially when reading a paper from another domain, in those kind of situations this dual chatbot system will ask the right questions and also provide answers to them.</p>
