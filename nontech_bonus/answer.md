<p>As stated in the SOP I would really like to do some work over making in house llm models from scratch</p>
<h3>Problems that might be faced</h3>
<p>Building a LLM from scratch comes with a lot of challenges </p>
<ul>
  <li>Getting the huge amount of data required.</li>
  <li>Managing the huge amount of money and computational resources required.</li>
  <li>Finally a pinch of uniqueness to standout from the giants like OpenAI.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other thing i would love to work upon is how generative AI can be utilized in different sectors like banking,education,construction etc.</p>
